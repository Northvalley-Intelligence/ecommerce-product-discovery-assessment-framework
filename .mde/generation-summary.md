# Generation Summary

Focus:
Generation 6 competitor pricing and discovery benchmark: identify relevant Boxercraft competitors, compare public direct-site price ranges for common apparel categories, and run comparable public search/autocomplete/browse checks where automation can collect evidence.

Codebase Change:
- Files changed: competitor evaluator, framework validator, package script, GEN-006 evidence, and project-local MDE status records
- Production/report files: 0 report/deck changes
- Test/validator files: 2
- Config/state/docs files: MDE state, strategy, findings, generation summary, validation runs, progress/task/risk/coverage, and release-check records
- LOC added: measured at commit time
- LOC deleted: measured at commit time
- Net LOC: measured at commit time

Validation Result:
- Gate: pass
- Blocking findings: none
- Pass count: 2/2

Validator Findings:
- Functional: pass; `scripts/evaluate-competitor-pricing-discovery.mjs` generated GEN-006 competitor pricing/search/autocomplete/browse evidence
- Technical: pass; `npm run validate` checks the GEN-006 JSON/markdown evidence, screenshots, and required competitor coverage
- Usability: adequate for supporting evidence; generated markdown summary is readable but not yet folded into the client-facing report/deck
- UI Standards: not materially changed; report/deck PDFs were not modified in GEN-006
- External: public catalog feeds captured Boxercraft, L2 Brands, and Colosseum Athletics; Concepts Sport and Fanatics remain limited or non-comparable in this automated pass

Useful Signals:
- Boxercraft is the only tested direct-brand site with public flannel-pant catalog matches: 37 products, $26.85-$42.85.
- Broader pants/joggers/sweatpants: Boxercraft $26.85-$58.85, L2 Brands $29.99-$79.95, Colosseum Athletics $15.00-$55.00.
- Quarter zips: Boxercraft $29.99-$98.85, L2 Brands $44.95-$74.95, Colosseum Athletics $20.00-$60.00.
- UCLA/Bruins public catalog visibility: Colosseum 20 matches versus Boxercraft 6 in the tested direct-site feeds.
- Search/autocomplete/browse benchmark scores: Boxercraft 78, Colosseum 55, L2 Brands 46, Concepts Sport 3, Fanatics 3 under the GEN-006 scoring method.

Noisy / Low-Signal Validators:
- Concepts Sport public Wix catalog did not expose comparable prices or product-grid titles through automation; manual or alternate-source validation is needed before client-facing claims.
- Fanatics is useful as a marketplace benchmark, but not comparable to direct brand-owned catalog feeds in this automated scope.

Repository Governance:
- Current branch: `main`, tracking `origin/main`.
- GitHub remote: `origin` -> `https://github.com/Northvalley-Intelligence/ecommerce-product-discovery-assessment-framework.git`.
- GitHub submission: GEN-006 benchmark commit `e9988ff2ec5791875b013069b98fd560f1c805cb` is on `origin/main`; verify the latest relocation-handoff commit with `git rev-parse HEAD` after restart.
- Production parity: not applicable yet; `deploy/build-manifest.json` records `platform` as `not_selected` and no production deployment exists.

Recommendation:
- After relocating the repo out of iCloud Drive, verify the working tree in the new path, then decide whether the competitor benchmark should be incorporated into the client-facing report/deck or remain supporting evidence.
